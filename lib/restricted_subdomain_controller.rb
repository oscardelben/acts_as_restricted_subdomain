      # == General
      #
      # Enables subdomain restrictions by adding a before_filter and helper to
      # access the current subdomain through current_subdomain in the
      # controller.
      #
      # == Usage
      #
      # Takes two arguments: :through and :by. :through should be a class of the
      # model used to represent the subdomain (defaults to Agency) and the :by
      # should be the column name of the field containing the subdomain
      # (defaults to :code).
      #
      # == Working Example
      #
      # For example, the usage of Agency and :code will work out thusly:
      #
      # In app/controllers/application.rb (or any other!) add:
      #   use_restricted_subdomains :through => 'Agency', :by => :code
      #
      # 1. Request hits http://secksi.example.com/login
      # 2. Subdomain becomes 'secksi'
      # 3. The corresponding 'Agency' with a ':code' of 'secksi' becomes the
      #    current subdomain. If it's not found, an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
      #    is thrown to automatically raise a 404 not found.
      #
      # == account_location
      #
      # This plugin is very similar to the functionality of the account_location
      # plugin written by DHH. There are three basic differences between them,
      # though. This plugin allows for any model and any column, not just
      # @account.username like account_plugin. I also wanted epic failure if a
      # subdomain was not found, not just pretty "uh oh" or a default page.
      # There should be no choice -- just finished. The plugin also integrates
      # with the model, you cannot access information outside of your domain
      # for any model tagged with subdomain restrictions. If your users are
      # limited to a subdomain, you cannot in any way access the users from
      # another subdomain simply by typing User.find(params[:random_id]).
      # It should also provide an epic failure.
      #
      # This plugin provides that kind of separation. It was designed to provide
      # separation of data in a medical application so as to run _n_ different
      # instances of an application in _1_ instance of the application, with
      # software restrictions that explicitly and implicitly forbid access
      # outside of your natural subdomain.
      #
      # Funny story: I actually completely finished this part of the plugin...
      # Then i discovered that account_location existed and did pretty much the
      # same thing without any meta-programming. Good times :)
